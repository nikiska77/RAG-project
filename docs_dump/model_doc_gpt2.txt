OpenAI GPT2

Overview
OpenAI GPT-2 model was proposed in Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners by Alec
Radford, Jeffrey Wu, Rewon Child, David Luan, Dario Amodei and Ilya Sutskever from OpenAI. It's a causal (unidirectional)
transformer pretrained using language modeling on a very large corpus of ~40 GB of text data.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset[1] of 8 million
web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some
text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks
across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than
10X the amount of data.
Write With Transformer is a webapp created and hosted by
Hugging Face showcasing the generative capabilities of several models. GPT-2 is one of them and is available in five
different sizes: small, medium, large, xl and a distilled version of the small checkpoint: distilgpt-2.
This model was contributed by thomwolf. The original code can be found here.
Usage tips

GPT-2 is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than
  the left.
GPT-2 was trained with a causal language modeling (CLM) objective and is therefore powerful at predicting the next
  token in a sequence. Leveraging this feature allows GPT-2 to generate syntactically coherent text as it can be
  observed in the run_generation.py example script.
The model can take the past_key_values (for PyTorch) or past (for TF) as input, which is the previously computed
  key/value attention pairs. Using this (past_key_values or past) value prevents the model from re-computing
  pre-computed values in the context of text generation. For PyTorch, see past_key_values argument of the
  [GPT2Model.forward] method, or for TF the past argument of the
  [TFGPT2Model.call] method for more information on its usage.
Enabling the scale_attn_by_inverse_layer_idx and reorder_and_upcast_attn flags will apply the training stability
  improvements from Mistral (for PyTorch only).
