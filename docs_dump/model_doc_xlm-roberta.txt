XLM-RoBERTa

Overview
The XLM-RoBERTa model was proposed in Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning at Scale by Alexis Conneau, Kartikay Khandelwal, Naman Goyal, Vishrav Chaudhary, Guillaume
Wenzek, Francisco GuzmÃ¡n, Edouard Grave, Myle Ott, Luke Zettlemoyer and Veselin Stoyanov. It is based on Facebook's
RoBERTa model released in 2019. It is a large multi-lingual language model, trained on 2.5TB of filtered CommonCrawl
data.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
This paper shows that pretraining multilingual language models at scale leads to significant performance gains for a
wide range of cross-lingual transfer tasks. We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred
languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly
outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +13.8% average accuracy on
XNLI, +12.3% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.1% average F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on
low-resource languages, improving 11.8% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 9.2% for Urdu over the previous XLM model. We
also present a detailed empirical evaluation of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the
trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource
languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing
per-language performance; XLM-Ris very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We
will make XLM-R code, data, and models publicly available.
This model was contributed by stefan-it. The original code can be found here.
Usage tips

XLM-RoBERTa is a multilingual model trained on 100 different languages. Unlike some XLM multilingual models, it does
  not require lang tensors to understand which language is used, and should be able to determine the correct
  language from the input ids.
Uses RoBERTa tricks on the XLM approach, but does not use the translation language modeling objective. It only uses masked language modeling on sentences coming from one language.
