DistilBERT

Overview
The DistilBERT model was proposed in the blog post Smaller, faster, cheaper, lighter: Introducing DistilBERT, a
distilled version of BERT, and the paper DistilBERT, a
distilled version of BERT: smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter. DistilBERT is a
small, fast, cheap and light Transformer model trained by distilling BERT base. It has 40% less parameters than
bert-base-uncased, runs 60% faster while preserving over 95% of BERT's performances as measured on the GLUE language
understanding benchmark.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
As Transfer Learning from large-scale pre-trained models becomes more prevalent in Natural Language Processing (NLP),
operating these large models in on-the-edge and/or under constrained computational training or inference budgets
remains challenging. In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-purpose language representation
model, called DistilBERT, which can then be fine-tuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger
counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage
knowledge distillation during the pretraining phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by
40%, while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the inductive
biases learned by larger models during pretraining, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling,
distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we
demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device
study.
This model was contributed by victorsanh. This model jax version was
contributed by kamalkraj. The original code can be found here.
Usage tips

DistilBERT doesn't have token_type_ids, you don't need to indicate which token belongs to which segment. Just
  separate your segments with the separation token tokenizer.sep_token (or [SEP]).
DistilBERT doesn't have options to select the input positions (position_ids input). This could be added if
  necessary though, just let us know if you need this option.

Same as BERT but smaller. Trained by distillation of the pretrained BERT model, meaning it‚Äôs been trained to predict the same probabilities as the larger model. The actual objective is a combination of:

finding the same probabilities as the teacher model
predicting the masked tokens correctly (but no next-sentence objective)
a cosine similarity between the hidden states of the student and the teacher model

Combining DistilBERT and Flash Attention 2
First, make sure to install the latest version of Flash Attention 2 to include the sliding window attention feature.

pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
Make also sure that you have a hardware that is compatible with Flash-Attention 2. Read more about it in the official documentation of flash-attn repository. Make also sure to load your model in half-precision (e.g. torch.float16)
To load and run a model using Flash Attention 2, refer to the snippet below:
thon

import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-uncased')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased", torch_dtype=torch.float16, use_flash_attention_2=True)
text = "Replace me by any text you'd like."
encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt').to(device)
model.to(device)
output = model(**encoded_input)
