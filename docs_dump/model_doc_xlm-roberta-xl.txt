XLM-RoBERTa-XL
Overview
The XLM-RoBERTa-XL model was proposed in Larger-Scale Transformers for Multilingual Masked Language Modeling by Naman Goyal, Jingfei Du, Myle Ott, Giri Anantharaman, Alexis Conneau. 
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-lingual language model pretraining for cross-lingual understanding. In this study, we present the results of two larger multilingual masked language models, with 3.5B and 10.7B parameters. Our two new models dubbed XLM-R XL and XLM-R XXL outperform XLM-R by 1.8% and 2.4% average accuracy on XNLI. Our model also outperforms the RoBERTa-Large model on several English tasks of the GLUE benchmark by 0.3% on average while handling 99 more languages. This suggests pretrained models with larger capacity may obtain both strong performance on high-resource languages while greatly improving low-resource languages. We make our code and models publicly available.
This model was contributed by Soonhwan-Kwon and stefan-it. The original code can be found here.
Usage tips
XLM-RoBERTa-XL is a multilingual model trained on 100 different languages. Unlike some XLM multilingual models, it does 
not require lang tensors to understand which language is used, and should be able to determine the correct 
language from the input ids.
