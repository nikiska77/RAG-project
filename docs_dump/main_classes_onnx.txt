Exporting ðŸ¤— Transformers models to ONNX
ðŸ¤— Transformers provides a transformers.onnx package that enables you to
convert model checkpoints to an ONNX graph by leveraging configuration objects.
See the guide on exporting ðŸ¤— Transformers models for more
details.
ONNX Configurations
We provide three abstract classes that you should inherit from, depending on the
type of model architecture you wish to export:

Encoder-based models inherit from [~onnx.config.OnnxConfig]
Decoder-based models inherit from [~onnx.config.OnnxConfigWithPast]
Encoder-decoder models inherit from [~onnx.config.OnnxSeq2SeqConfigWithPast]

OnnxConfig

OnnxConfigWithPast

OnnxSeq2SeqConfigWithPast

ONNX Features
Each ONNX configuration is associated with a set of features that enable you
to export models for different types of topologies or tasks.
