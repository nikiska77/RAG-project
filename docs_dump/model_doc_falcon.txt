Falcon
Overview
Falcon is a class of causal decoder-only models built by TII. The largest Falcon checkpoints
have been trained on >=1T tokens of text, with a particular emphasis on the RefinedWeb
corpus. They are made available under the Apache 2.0 license.
Falcon's architecture is modern and optimized for inference, with multi-query attention and support for efficient
attention variants like FlashAttention. Both 'base' models trained only as causal language models as well as
'instruct' models that have received further fine-tuning are available.
Falcon models are (as of 2023) some of the largest and most powerful open-source language models,
and consistently rank highly in the OpenLLM leaderboard.
Converting custom checkpoints

Falcon models were initially added to the Hugging Face Hub as custom code checkpoints. However, Falcon is now fully
supported in the Transformers library. If you fine-tuned a model from a custom code checkpoint, we recommend converting
your checkpoint to the new in-library format, as this should give significant improvements to stability and
performance, especially for generation, as well as removing the need to use trust_remote_code=True!

You can convert custom code checkpoints to full Transformers checkpoints using the convert_custom_code_checkpoint.py 
script located in the
Falcon model directory
of the Transformers library. To use this script, simply call it with 
python convert_custom_code_checkpoint.py --checkpoint_dir my_model. This will convert your checkpoint in-place, and
you can immediately load it from the directory afterwards with e.g. from_pretrained(). If your model hasn't been
uploaded to the Hub, we recommend making a backup before attempting the conversion, just in case!
