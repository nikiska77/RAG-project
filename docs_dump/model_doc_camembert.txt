CamemBERT
Overview
The CamemBERT model was proposed in CamemBERT: a Tasty French Language Model by
Louis Martin, Benjamin Muller, Pedro Javier Ortiz Suárez, Yoann Dupont, Laurent Romary, Éric Villemonte de la
Clergerie, Djamé Seddah, and Benoît Sagot. It is based on Facebook's RoBERTa model released in 2019. It is a model
trained on 138GB of French text.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Pretrained language models are now ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing. Despite their success, most available
models have either been trained on English data or on the concatenation of data in multiple languages. This makes
practical use of such models --in all languages except English-- very limited. Aiming to address this issue for French,
we release CamemBERT, a French version of the Bi-directional Encoders for Transformers (BERT). We measure the
performance of CamemBERT compared to multilingual models in multiple downstream tasks, namely part-of-speech tagging,
dependency parsing, named-entity recognition, and natural language inference. CamemBERT improves the state of the art
for most of the tasks considered. We release the pretrained model for CamemBERT hoping to foster research and
downstream applications for French NLP.
This model was contributed by camembert. The original code can be found here.

This implementation is the same as RoBERTa. Refer to the documentation of RoBERTa for usage examples as well 
as the information relative to the inputs and outputs.
