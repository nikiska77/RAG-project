MobileViTV2
Overview
The MobileViTV2 model was proposed in Separable Self-attention for Mobile Vision Transformers by Sachin Mehta and Mohammad Rastegari.
MobileViTV2 is the second version of MobileViT, constructed by replacing the multi-headed self-attention in MobileViT with separable self-attention.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Mobile vision transformers (MobileViT) can achieve state-of-the-art performance across several mobile vision tasks, including classification and detection. Though these models have fewer parameters, they have high latency as compared to convolutional neural network-based models. The main efficiency bottleneck in MobileViT is the multi-headed self-attention (MHA) in transformers, which requires O(k2) time complexity with respect to the number of tokens (or patches) k. Moreover, MHA requires costly operations (e.g., batch-wise matrix multiplication) for computing self-attention, impacting latency on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a separable self-attention method with linear complexity, i.e. O(k). A simple yet effective characteristic of the proposed method is that it uses element-wise operations for computing self-attention, making it a good choice for resource-constrained devices. The improved model, MobileViTV2, is state-of-the-art on several mobile vision tasks, including ImageNet object classification and MS-COCO object detection. With about three million parameters, MobileViTV2 achieves a top-1 accuracy of 75.6% on the ImageNet dataset, outperforming MobileViT by about 1% while running 3.2Ã— faster on a mobile device.

Usage tips

MobileViTV2 is more like a CNN than a Transformer model. It does not work on sequence data but on batches of images. Unlike ViT, there are no embeddings. The backbone model outputs a feature map.
One can use [MobileViTImageProcessor] to prepare images for the model. Note that if you do your own preprocessing, the pretrained checkpoints expect images to be in BGR pixel order (not RGB).
The available image classification checkpoints are pre-trained on ImageNet-1k (also referred to as ILSVRC 2012, a collection of 1.3 million images and 1,000 classes).
The segmentation model uses a DeepLabV3 head. The available semantic segmentation checkpoints are pre-trained on PASCAL VOC.
