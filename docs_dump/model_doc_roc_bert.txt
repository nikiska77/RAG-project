RoCBert
Overview
The RoCBert model was proposed in RoCBert: Robust Chinese Bert with Multimodal Contrastive Pretraining  by HuiSu, WeiweiShi, XiaoyuShen, XiaoZhou, TuoJi, JiaruiFang, JieZhou.
It's a pretrained Chinese language model that is robust under various forms of adversarial attacks.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
Large-scale pretrained language models have achieved SOTA results on NLP tasks. However, they have been shown
vulnerable to adversarial attacks especially for logographic languages like Chinese. In this work, we propose
ROCBERT: a pretrained Chinese Bert that is robust to various forms of adversarial attacks like word perturbation,
synonyms, typos, etc. It is pretrained with the contrastive learning objective which maximizes the label consistency
under different synthesized adversarial examples. The model takes as input multimodal information including the
semantic, phonetic and visual features. We show all these features are important to the model robustness since the
attack can be performed in all the three forms. Across 5 Chinese NLU tasks, ROCBERT outperforms strong baselines under
three blackbox adversarial algorithms without sacrificing the performance on clean testset. It also performs the best
in the toxic content detection task under human-made attacks.
This model was contributed by weiweishi.
