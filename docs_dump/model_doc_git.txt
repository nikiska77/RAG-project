Overview
The GIT model was proposed in GIT: A Generative Image-to-text Transformer for Vision and Language by
Jianfeng Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Xiaowei Hu, Linjie Li, Kevin Lin, Zhe Gan, Zicheng Liu, Ce Liu, Lijuan Wang. GIT is a decoder-only Transformer
that leverages CLIP's vision encoder to condition the model on vision inputs besides text. The model obtains state-of-the-art results on
image captioning and visual question answering benchmarks.
The abstract from the paper is the following:
In this paper, we design and train a Generative Image-to-text Transformer, GIT, to unify vision-language tasks such as image/video captioning and question answering. While generative models provide a consistent network architecture between pre-training and fine-tuning, existing work typically contains complex structures (uni/multi-modal encoder/decoder) and depends on external modules such as object detectors/taggers and optical character recognition (OCR). In GIT, we simplify the architecture as one image encoder and one text decoder under a single language modeling task. We also scale up the pre-training data and the model size to boost the model performance. Without bells and whistles, our GIT establishes new state of the arts on 12 challenging benchmarks with a large margin. For instance, our model surpasses the human performance for the first time on TextCaps (138.2 vs. 125.5 in CIDEr). Furthermore, we present a new scheme of generation-based image classification and scene text recognition, achieving decent performance on standard benchmarks.

Usage tips

GIT is implemented in a very similar way to GPT-2, the only difference being that the model is also conditioned on pixel_values.
