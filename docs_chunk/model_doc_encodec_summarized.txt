The EnCodec neural codec model was proposed in High Fidelity Neural Audio Compression by Alexandre DÃ©fossez, Jade Copet, Gabriel Synnaeve, Yossi Adi. It consists in a streaming encoder-decoder architecture with quantized latent space trained in an end-to-end fashion. It is superior to the baselines methods across all evaluated settings, considering both 24 kHz monophonic and 48 kHz stereophonic audio. Here is a quick example of how to encode and decode an audio using this model. The original code can be found here. The model was contributed by Matthijs, Patrick Von Platen and Arthur Zucker. It was also contributed by Patrick Von platen andArthur Zucker. For more information, visit the En Codec website. It can be downloaded from the GitHub site here. Back to the page you came from.
