Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) is a set of tools and models for state-of-the-art open-domain Q&A research. It was introduced in Dense Question Answering by Vladimir Karpukhin, Barlas OÄŸuz, Patrick Lewis, Ledell Wu, Danqi Chen, Sergey Edunov, Wen-tau Yih. It consists of three models:Question encoder: encode questions as vectors,Reader: extract the answer of the questions inside retrieved contexts, along with a relevance score (high if the inferred span actually answers the question) The original code can be found here. The abstract from the paper is the following:.Open-domain question answering relies on efficient passage retrieval to select candidate contexts, where traditional. vector space models, such as TF-IDF or BM25, are the de facto method. In this work, we show that retrieval can. be practically implemented using dense representations alone, where embeddings are learned from a small number of.questions and passages by a simple dual-encoder framework. When evaluated on a wide range of open- domain QA datasets, dense retriever outperforms a strong Lucene-BM25 system largely by 9%-19% absolute in terms of top-20 passage.retrieval accuracy.
