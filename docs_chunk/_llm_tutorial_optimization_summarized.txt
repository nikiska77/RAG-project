Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing in their ability to tackle human-centric tasks. To exhibit near-human text understanding and generation capabilities, LLMs currently require to be composed of billions of parameters. The crux of these challenges lies in augmenting the computational and memory capabilities of LLMs, especially when handling expansive input sequences. In this guide, we will go over the effective techniques for efficient LLM deployment. We delve into the pros and cons of adopting lower precision, provide a comprehensive exploration of the latest attention algorithms, and discuss improved LLM architectures. While doing so, we run practical examples showcasing each of the feature improvements.summarize:                 Optimizing LLMs for Speed and Memory                [[open-in-colab]]                 Optimize LLM for speed and memory                â€™â€˚â€ž “‘’’ ‘ ’  ”’,’.’,.”,”.”,.’.,’;’ ’'’: “”; ’, ’”: ’; ”,  , ‘;  ; ‚’ : ‘, ”. ’,. ’,'’': ’. ”,. ”;  :  . , ,.  ,. ;”.,  ., ’:’',’],’,'',”,'”",’",”,"’,"”',“,‚”  ” ‘; .  +.’%.’
