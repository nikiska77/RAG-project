By default, TrainingArguments.report_to is set to "all", so a [Trainer] will use the following callbacks. If a package is installed but you don't wish to use the accompanying integration, you can change it to a list of just those integrations you want to use. For customizations that require changes in the training loop, you should override the methods you need (see trainer for examples).
