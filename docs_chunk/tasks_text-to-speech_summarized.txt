Text-to-speech (TTS) is the task of creating natural-sounding speech from text. Several TTS models are available in Transformers, such as Bark, MMS, VITS and SpeechT5. Fine-tune a TTS model in one of two ways: using a pipeline or directly. Use the "text- to-audio" pipeline to generate audio using Bark or MMS. Use a pipelined version of Bark to create audio using MMS or VITS to create speech using speechbrain or speechbrain. Use speechbrain to generate speech in multiple languages and for multiple speakers. Usespeechbrain to produce speech in different languages and multiple speakers using multiplexing and x-varsities. Use Speechbrain to create different types of speech using different speech models and different speech patterns. Use  speech brain to generate multiple speech patterns using multiple speech models or different speech-like expressions such as "clears throat" and "I just took a long pause" or "This is a test  and I just took an long pause." or "I'm not sure why I'm saying this" or some other non-verbal communication such as laughing, sighing and crying. Use your refined model for inference in either the pipeline or the directly-injected version of the Bark model.
