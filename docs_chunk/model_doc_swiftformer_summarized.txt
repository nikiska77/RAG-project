The SwiftFormer model was proposed in SwiftFormer: Efficient Additive Attention for Transformer-based Real-time Mobile Vision Applications by Abdelrahman Shaker, Muhammad Maaz, Hanoona Rasheed, Salman Khan, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Fahad Shahbaz Khan. A series of models called 'SwiftFormer' is built based on this, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and mobile inference speed. Even their small variant achieves 78.5% top-1 ImageNet1K accuracy with only 0.8 ms latency on iPhone 14, which is more accurate and 2x faster compared to MobileViT-v2. The abstract from the paper is the following:Self-attention has become a defacto choice for capturing global context in various vision applications. However, its quadratic computational complexity with respect to image resolution limits its use in real-time applications, especially for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices. Although hybrid approaches have been proposed to combine the advantages of convolutions and self-att attention for a better speed-accuracy trade-off, the expensive matrix multiplication operations in self-Attention remain a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a novel efficient additive attention mechanism that effectively replaces the quadratically matrix multiplication Operations with linear element-wise multiplications.
