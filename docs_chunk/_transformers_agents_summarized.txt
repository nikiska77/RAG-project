Transformers Agents is an experimental API which is subject to change at any time. Results returned by the agents can vary as the APIs or underlying models are prone to change. It is extensible by design; we curated some relevant tools, but we'll show you how the system can be extended easily to use any tool developed by the community. Let's start with a few examples of what can be achieved with this new API. It's particularly powerful when it comes  to multimodal tasks, so let's take it for a spin to generate images and read text out loud. You can play with in                this colab.summarize:    Transformers Agent's API. The API is based on transformers version v4.29.0, building on the concept of tools and agents. It provides a natural language API on top of transformers: we define a set of curated tools and design an                 agent to interpret natural language and to use these tools. We hope you will use it to help you with your work with transformers, and if you have any questions, please contact us at support@transformers.org or call the support line at 1-800-287-8255 or email support@Transformers.com.
