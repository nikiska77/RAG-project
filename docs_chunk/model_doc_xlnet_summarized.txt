The XLNet model was proposed in XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding by Zhilin Yang, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Quoc V. Le. XLNet is an extension of the Transformer-XL model pre-trained using an autoregressive method to learn bidirectional contexts. It is pretrained using only a sub-set of the output tokens as target which are selected with the target_mapping input. The specific attention pattern can be controlled at training and test time using the perm_mask input. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking. This model was contributed by thomwolf. The original code can be found here. The abstract from the paper is the following:With the capability of modeling bid Directional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autore progressive language modeling. However, relying oncorrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from apretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet.
