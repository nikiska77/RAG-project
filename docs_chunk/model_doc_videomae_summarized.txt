VideoMAE extends masked auto encoders (MAE) to video, claiming state-of-the-art performance on several video classification benchmarks. An extremely high proportion of masking ratio (i.e., 90% to 95%) still yields favorable performance of VideoMAE. A list of official Hugging Face resources to help you get started with VideoMAe. Ifyou're interested in submitting a resource to be included here, please feel free to open a Pull Request and we'll review it! The resource should ideally demonstrate something new, and should ideally be able to demonstrate that it can be used in a real-world application. The original code can be found here. The abstract from the paper is the following:Pre-training video transformers on extra large-scale datasets is generally required to achieve premier performance on relatively small datasets. In this paper, we show that video masked autoencoders are data-efficient learners for self-supervised video pre-training (SSVP) We are inspired by the recent ImageMAE and propose customized video tube masking and reconstruction. These simple designs turn out to be effective for overcoming information leakage caused by the temporal correlation during video reconstruction. This is partially ascribed to the challenging task of video reconstruction to enforce high-level structure learning. The temporally redundant video content enables higher masking Ratio than that of images. (2) videoMAE achieves impressive results on very small datasets (i.-e., around 3k-4k videos) without using any extra data.
