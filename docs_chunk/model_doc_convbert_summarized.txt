ConvBERT model was proposed in ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution by Zihang Jiang, Weihao Yu, Daquan Zhou, Yunpeng Chen, Jiashi Feng, ShuichengYan. Code and pre-trained models will be released. The original implementation can be found here: https://github.com/yitu-opensource/ConvBert. The training tips are similar to those of BERT. For usage tips refer to BERT documentation. The model was contributed by abhishek. The paper was published in the open-source journal O'Reilly Open Source Software.
