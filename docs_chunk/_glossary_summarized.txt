The attention mask is an optional argument used when batching sequences together. The argument indicates to the model which tokens should be attended to, and which should not. The first sequence needs to be padded up to the length of the second one. The second one needs to been truncated down to thelength of the first one. This can then be converted into a tensor in PyTorch or TensorFlow. The attention masks is a binary tensor. It can be used to create tensors for machine learning and Transformers.
