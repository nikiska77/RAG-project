Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT) is a new architecture. CvT models are regular Vision Transformers, but trained with convolutions. They outperform the original model (ViT) when fine-tuned on ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-100. The model was contributed by anugunj. The original code can be found here. You can check out demo notebooks regarding inference as well as fine- tuning the model.
