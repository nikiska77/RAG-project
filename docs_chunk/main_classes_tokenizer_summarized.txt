Tokenizer is in charge of preparing the inputs for a model. The library contains tokenizers for all the models. Most of the tokenizers are available in two flavors: a full python implementation and a "Fast" implementation based on theRust library ðŸ¤— Tokenizers. A tokenizer is a class that holds the various model inputs computed by methods ( input_ids, attention_mask) The base classes [PreTrainedTokenizer] and [ preTokenizerFast] implement the main methods for using all the tokenizer classes. The tokenizers can be downloaded from HuggingFace's AWS S3 repository or from a pretrained tokenizer provided by the library. For more information, see Hugging face's Tokenizers website. The Tokenizers library is available on GitHub and on the Huggingface website. It's free and open-source, and can be used by anyone with Python or Rust skills and the ability to use it in a variety of ways.
