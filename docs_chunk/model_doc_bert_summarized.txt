The BERT model was proposed in BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding by Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee and Kristina Toutanova. It's a bidirectional transformer pretrained using a combination of masked language modeling objective and next sentence prediction. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLIaccuracy to 86.7%, and SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absoluteimprovement) The original code can be found here. The abstract from the paper is the following:We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bid Directional Encoder Representations                from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep biddirectionalrepresentations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT models can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state- of-the.art models for a wide range of tasks.
