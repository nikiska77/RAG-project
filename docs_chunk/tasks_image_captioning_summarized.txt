Image captioning is the task of predicting a caption for a given image. Common real world applications of it includeaiding visually impaired people that can help them navigate through different situations. Image captioninghelps to improve content accessibility for people by describing images to them. This guide will show you how to fine-tune an image captioning model and use the fine-tuned model for inference. We encourage you to log in to your Hugging Face account so you can upload and share your model with the community. Use the Dataset library to load a dataset that consists of {image-caption} pairs. The Pok√©mon BLIP captions dataset has two features, image and text. To create your own image Captioning dataset in PyTorch, you can follow this notebook. We hope you will use this guide to help you with your training and inference of image captions in the future. Back to the page you came from.
