On this page, we will have a closer look at tokenization. tokenizing a text is splitting it into words or subwords, which are then converted to ids through a look-up table. We will look at the three main types of tokenizers used in ðŸ¤— Transformers: Byte-Pair Encoding(BPE), WordPiece, and SentencePiece. We'll also show examples of which tokenizer type is used by which model.summarize:  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  The tokenizer page includes a summary of the tokenizer types used by the pretrained model and examples of how they are used in Transformers. The tokenizers page also includes an example of how to use the tokenizers in the real world, such as how to tokenize the word "Transformers" in a real-world application. The tokens page includes examples of the tokens used in thereal-world, including how toTokenizeTransformers in the Real-World, and how to Tokenize Transformers in theReal-World. The Tokenizer page also contains an example for tokenizing Transformers in real-life, as well as examples for tokenization in the simulator and in the browser. TheTokenizer page is also available as a free download for the Mac and the PC.
