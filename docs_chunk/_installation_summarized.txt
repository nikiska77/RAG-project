Transformers is tested on Python 3.6+, PyTorch 1.1.0, TensorFlow 2.0+, and Flax. Follow the installation instructions below for the deep learning library you are using. You should install Transformers in a virtual environment. A virtual environment makes it easier to manage different projects, and avoid compatibility issues between dependencies. If you're unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, take a look at this guide. For CPU-support only, you can conveniently install Transformers and a deeplearning library in one line. For example, install ðŸ¤— Transformers andPyTorch with: python -m venv.envActivate the virtual environment on Linux and MacOs. On Windows, run the following command to install Transformers on Windows: python install transformers[tf-cpu]Transformers will download a pretrained model and print out the label and score: 'POSITIVE','score': 0.9998704791069031, 'label':'POSITIVE' and'Label':'sentiment-analysis' (pipeline('sentiment')('we love you')) "Transformers" is available on GitHub:https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/Transformers. You can also install Transformers from source with the command: python-pip install git+https:// GitHub.com/.
