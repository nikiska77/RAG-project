There is one class of AutoModel for each task, and for each backend (PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Flax) Each of the auto classes has a method to be extended with your custom classes. For instance, if you have defined a custom class of model NewModel, make sure you have a NewModelConfig then you can add those to the autoclasses. The following auto classes are available for instantiating a base model class without a specific head. The auto classes can also be used to create custom models for different types of data structures. For more information on how to use the Auto Classes, see the official documentation. The official documentation can be found at: http://www.python.org/ python/automation/auto-classes.html. The latest version of this article includes the latest versions of the AutoConfig, AutoModel, and AutoTokenizer classes as well as the AutoFeatureExtractor and AutoImageProcessor classes. The final version of the article will include the new AutoProcessor and AutoFeatureextractor classes. It will also include a new AutoModel class for creating a new model with a specific type. The full version of AutoClasses is available on GitHub at:http:// www. python.com/ python-automated/autoplay/autoclasses/AutoClasses.php.
