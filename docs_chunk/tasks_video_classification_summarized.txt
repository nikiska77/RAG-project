You will use PyTorchVideo (dubbed pytorchvideo) to process and prepare the videos. We encourage you to log in to your Hugging Face account so you can upload and share your model with the community.load a subset of the UCF-101 dataset. This will give you a chance to experiment and make sure everything works before spending more time training on the full dataset. At a high level, the dataset is organized like so:UCF101_subset/Train/Archery/BandMarching/Val/Val.summarize:         ‘’  ’’.’ ’”.”’ – ‘” – ’. ’ ”. ‘ –  . “ – “.  ”, ‘. ‚’,. ’,  ,.  , ’;’,’;. ””,. “’: ”; . ,.’%;’%.’.;’., ’:’!’}.’.’+.’.'’.:’
