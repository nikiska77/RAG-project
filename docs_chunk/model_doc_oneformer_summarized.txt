The OneFormer model was proposed in OneFormer: One Transformer to Rule Universal Image Segmentation by Jitesh Jain, Jiachen Li, MangTik Chiu, Ali Hassani, Nikita Orlov, Humphrey Shi. OneFormer is a universal image segmentation framework that can be trained on a single panoptic dataset. It uses a task token to condition the model on the task in focus, making the architecture task-guided for training, and task-dynamic for inference. It outperforms specialized Mask2Former models across all three segmentation tasks on ADE20k, CityScapes, and COCO, despite the latter being trained on each of the three tasks individually with three times the resources. With new ConvNeXt and DiNAT backbones, we observe even more performance improvement. We believe One former is a significant step towards making image segmentated more universal and accessible. The original code can be found here. The abstract from the paper is the following: One former model is a multi-task train-once design. We first propose a task-conditioned joint training strategy that enables training on ground truths of each domain within a single multi- task training process. We propose using a query-text contrastive loss during training to establish better inter-task and inter-class distinctions.
