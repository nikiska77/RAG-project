TrOCR is a pre-trained image Transformer and text Transformer model. TrOCR achieves state-of-the-art results on both printed and handwritten text recognition tasks. The model is simple and can be pre- trained with large-scale synthetic data and fine-tuned with human-labeled datasets. It is always used within the VisionEncoderDecoder framework. For more information, see the official models and Hugging Face pages. The original code can be found at: http://www.huggingface.org/trOCR.
