The Transformers library is designed to be easily extensible. Every model is fully coded in a given sub folder with no abstraction. In this tutorial, we will show you how to write a custom model and its configuration. We'll see how to build upon transformers and extend the framework with your hooks andcustom code. We will illustrate all of this on a ResNet model, by wrapping the ResNet class of the transformers library into a [PreTrainedModel]. We then just store those arguments, after checking the validity of a few of them. The configuration of a model is an object that will contain all the necessary information to build the model. As we will see in the next section, the model can only take a config to be initialized, so we really need that object to be as complete as possible. The model will then be able to be used inside Transformers, and you can share it with the community (with the code it relies on) so that anyone can use it, even if it's not present in the ðŸ¤—Transformers library.summarize:  grotesquely-extended-Transformers-tutorial-1.0.0-1-0-0.1-2-0, p. 3.
