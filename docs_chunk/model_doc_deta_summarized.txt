The DETA model was proposed in NMS Strikes Back by Jeffrey Ouyang-Zhang, Jang Hyun Cho, Xingyi Zhou, Philipp Krähenbühl. DETA replaces the one-to-one bipartite Hungarian matching loss with one- to-many label assignments used in traditional detectors with non-maximum suppression (NMS) This leads to significant gains of up to 2.5 mAP.
