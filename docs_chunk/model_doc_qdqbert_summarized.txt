The QDQBERT model can be referenced in a paper by Hao Wu, Patrick Judd, Xiaojie Zhang, Mikhail Isaev and PauliusMicikevicius. The abstract from the paper is the following:Quantization techniques can reduce the size of Deep Neural Networks and improve inference latency and throughput by taking advantage of high throughput integer instructions. We focus on quantization techniques that are amenable to acceleration by processors with high-throughput integer math pipelines. We also present a workflow for 8-bit quantization that is                able to maintain accuracy within 1% of the floating-point baseline on all networks studied, including models that are more difficult to quantize. The model was contributed by shangz. It requires the dependency of Pytorch Quantization Toolkit. To install pip install pytorch-quantization --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com/pip/quantization-qdqbert. To use the model, install PytorCh Quantization toolkit and run the following commands: pip install PyTorch Quantification Toolkit and the command: python quantization-quantification-toolkit. pythonquantization. python QuantDesc. pythonQuantDesc.py QuantDesc is the module for quantizing tensors, with QuantDesc as the default.
