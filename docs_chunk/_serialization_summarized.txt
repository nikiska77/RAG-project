Optimum is an extension of Transformers that enables exporting models from PyTorch or TensorFlow to serialized formats such as ONNX and TFLite. Optimum also provides a set of performance optimization tools to train and run models on targeted hardware with maximum efficiency. This guide demonstrates how you can export Transformers models to ONNZ with Optimum. For the guide on exporting models to TFLit, please refer to the Export to T FLite page. For more information about Optimum, please visit the Optimum website or visit the official Optimum site. The Optimum documentation can be downloaded from the following site: http://www.optimum.com/en/blog/2014/01/26/optimum-exports-to-ONNX-guide.html#storylink=cpy.

The final version of this guide will be published on the same day as the release of Optimum’s ‘Export to NNNX’ guide. It will include the option to export models from Transformers to NNX with the option of exporting from Transformers with the ‘export’ option.
