The CPPE-5 dataset contains images withannotations identifying medical personal protective equipment (PPE) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset already comes with a training set containing 1000 images and a test set with 29 images. Log in to your Hugging Face account to upload it to the Hub.
