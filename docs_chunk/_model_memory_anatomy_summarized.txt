To understand performance optimization techniques that one can apply to improve efficiency of model training, it's helpful to get familiar with how GPU is utilized during training. Let's start by exploring a motivating example of GPU utilization and the training run of a model. For the demonstration, we'll need to install a few libraries: pip install transformers transformers datasets accelerate n Nvidia-ml-py3 library allows us to monitor the memory usage of the models from within Python. Then, we create some dummy data: random token IDs between 100 and 30000 and binary labels for a classifier. In total, we get 512 sequences each with length 512 and store them in a [~datasets.Dataset] with PyTorch format. To print summary statistics for the model utilization and training run with the [Trainer] we define two helper functions: print_gpu_utilization and print_summary.summarize:  grotesquely, the training anatomy of a machine learning model is a complex one.
