The Model Hub allows you to share a trained or fine-tuned model with the community. To share a model, you need an account on huggingface.co. You can also join an existing organization or create a new one. Each repository on the Model Hub behaves like a typical GitHub repository. Our repositories offer versioning, commit history, and the ability to visualize differences. The Model Hub's built-in versioning is based on git and git-lfs. In other words, you can treat one model as one repository, enabling greater access control and scalability. The Hub is free to use, but you will need to pay a small fee to use it. For more information about the Hub, visit the Hub's official website or visit Hugging Face's official site.
