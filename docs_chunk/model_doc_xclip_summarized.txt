X-CLIP is a minimal extension of CLIP for video. The model consists of a text encoder, a cross-frame vision encoder and a multi-frame integration Transformer. It also has a video-specific prompt generator. It has a top-1 accuracy of 87.1% on Kinectics-400, while using 12 times fewer FLOPs compared with Swin-L and ViViT-H. In zero-shot experiments, our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods by +7.6% and +14.9% in terms of top- 1 accuracy under two popular protocols. In few-shot scenarios,. our approach outperforms previous best methods. by +32.1%. When the labeled data is extremely limited. The original code can be found here.
