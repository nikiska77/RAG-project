An AutoClass automatically infers the model architecture and downloads pretrained configuration and weights. Users who want more control over specific model parameters can create a custom Transformers model from just a few base classes. This could be particularly useful for anyone who is interested in studying, training or experimenting with a ðŸ¤— Transformers model.

Using a class to change a model's configuration. using a model class to modify a model. using the DistilBertModel to create a model with different attributes. using [DistilBERT] to inspect it's attributes. Using [DistILBERT]' to inspect the attributes of the base model. All the default attributes used to build a base model are shown here. All attributes are displayed in the [distilB BertConfig] directory.
