The CLVP (Contrastive Language-Voice Pretrained Transformer) model was proposed in Better speech synthesis through scaling by James Betker. The CLVP model is an integral part of the Tortoise TTS model. It can be used to compare different generated speech candidates with the provided text, and the best speech tokens are forwarded to the diffusion model. The result is TorToise - an expressive, multi-voice text-to-speech system. The model was contributed by Susnato Dhar. The original code can be found here. The abstract from the paper is the following: In recent years, the field of image generation has been revolutionized by the application of autoregressive transformers and DDPMs. These approaches model the process of. image generation as a step-wise probabilistic processes and leverage large amounts of compute and data to learn the image distribution. This methodology of improving performance need not be confined to images. This paper describes a way to apply advances in the image generative domain to speech synthesis. The end goal is to create a speech system that is expressive and efficient. The code for the CLVP system is available on GitHub. The full code for Tor toise is available at the following site: http://www.tortoise.org/tor-toise.
