There are 2 test suites in the repository: hypertests -- tests for the general API and examples -- tests primarily for applications that aren't part of the API. Every new commit to that PR gets retested with 9 CircleCi jobs. These jobs are defined in this config file, so that if needed you can reproduce the same environment on your machine. These CI jobs don't run @slow tests. There are 3 jobs run by GitHub actions:torch hub integration, push, and self-hosted. The results of these tests can be observed by running pytest tests/test_optimization. The test suite list can be found by running the following command: python -m pytest -n auto --dist=loadfile -s -v./tests/ --collect-only -q. The tests can also be run in verbose mode to get the list of all tests of a given test file. The full test suite can be seen by running: py test tests/ test-optimization -v -q -q. The tests file can be viewed by clicking on the test file and then clicking the test option: test- Optimization. It will display a list of the tests that have been run so far, and the results of each test.
