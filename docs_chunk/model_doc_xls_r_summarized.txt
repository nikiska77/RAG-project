XLS-R is a large-scale model for cross-lingual speech representation learning based on wav2vec 2.0. It is based on the Wav2Vec2 model. It can be used to train models with up to 2B parameters on nearly half a million hours of publicly available speech audio in 128 languages. The model was trained using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) so the model output has to be decoded using [Wav2 Vec2CTCTokenizer] The original code can be found here. The abstract from the paper is the following:. We show that with sufficient model size, cross- Lingual pretraining can outperform English-only pretraining when translating English speech into other languages, a setting which favors monolingualpretraining. We hope XLS- R can help to improve speech processing tasks for many more languages of the world. The full paper is available at:Â http://www.huggingface.co/models?other=xls_r.html#xls-r.
