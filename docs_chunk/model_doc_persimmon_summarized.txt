The Persimmon model was created by ADEPT, and authored by Erich Elsen, Augustus Odena, Maxwell Nye, Sağnak Taşırlar, Tri Dao, Curtis Hawthorne, Deepak Moparthi, Arushi Somani. The authors showcase their approach to model evaluation, focusing on practical text generation, mirroring how users interact with language models. The work also includes a comparative analysis, pitting PersimMon-8B against other prominent models (MPT 7B Instruct and Llama 2 Base 7B 1-Shot), across various evaluation tasks. They express their anticipation of how the community will leverage this contribution to drive innovation, hinting at further upcoming releases as part of an ongoing series of developments. It is a fully permissively-licensed model with approximately 8 billion parameters, released under the Apache license. Some of the key attributes of Persim mon are long context size (16K), performance, and capabilities for multimodal extensions. It was trained using bfloat16, but the original inference uses float16. The checkpoints uploaded on the hub use torch_dtype = 'float16' which will beused by the AutoModel API to cast the checkpoints from torch. float32 to torch.float16.
