The RegNet model was proposed in Designing Network Design Spaces by Ilija Radosavovic, Raj Prateek Kosaraju, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He, Piotr Doll√°r. The core insight of the RegNet parametrization is surprisingly simple: widths and depths of good networks can be explained by a quantized linear function. The RegNet design space provides simple and fast networks that work well across a wide range of flop regimes. Under comparable training settings and flops, the Reg net models outperform the popular EfficientNet models while being up to 5x faster on GPUs. The TensorFlow version of the model was contributed by sayakpaul and ariG23498. The original code can be found here. The huge 10B model from Self-supervised Pretraining of Visual Features in the Wild, trained on  one billion Instagram images, is available on the hub.
