Transformers has an AutoClass that infers and loads the correct architecture from a given checkpoint. The from_pretrained() method lets you quickly load a pretrained model for any architecture so you don't have to devote time and resources to train a model from scratch. Producing this type of checkpoint-agnostic code means if your code works for one checkpoint, it will work with another checkpoint - as long as it was trained for a similar task. Nearly every NLP task begins with a tokenizer. A tokenizer converts your input into a format that can be processed by the model. For vision tasks, an image is an image, an extractor is a feature extractor and a processor is a processor. For more information on how to use the Transformer library, visit the official website.

The next tutorial will focus on training a model for an image task. The third tutorial will look at training a feature Extractor for a vision task. It will also look at how to train an image extractor to extract a feature from an image. The fourth and final tutorial will be about training a processor to extract an image for a Vision task.
