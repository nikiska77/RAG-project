Learn how to use BetterTransformer for faster inference. Learn how to convert your PyTorch code to TorchScript. Use Optimum to accelerate inference with ONNX Runtime or OpenVINO (if you're using an Intel CPU) Use graph optimizations from Intel Extension to boost inference speed even more. For a gentle introduction to Torch Script, see the Introduction to Py Torch TorchScript tutorial. For more information, visit the TorchScript website. The TorchScript site is open-source and can be downloaded from the GitHub site. The official Torch Script site is available from the following sites: http://www.torchscript.org/ and http:// www.torcherScript.org/. The official version of TorchScript is available for download from the TorchScript website at http://torchScript.com/torch-script/TorchScript-1.0.0-1-0.html. It is available in English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish, and the official English version is available on the TorTorch website at http://torcher-script.com or the Torch Script site at  http://Torch Script.org or the TorcherScript site at http:www.TorcherScriptSite.com/.
