The [pipeline] is the easiest and fastest way to use a pretrained model for inference. You can use the pipeline out-of-the-box for many tasks across different modalities. For a complete list of available tasks, check out the pipeline API reference. We recommend checking out our tutorials or course next for more in-depth explanations of the concepts introduced here.summarize:  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Quick tour Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â [[open-in-colab]] Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Get up and running with ðŸ¤— Transformers! Whether you're a developer or an everyday user, this quick tour will help you get started and show you how to use the [p Pipeline] for inference, load a model and preprocessor with an AutoClass, and quickly train a model with PyTorch or TensorFlow. You'll also need to install your preferred machine learning framework:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Pip install torchÂ Â Â Â Â pip install tensorflowÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€˜Pipelineâ€™ is the name of the API that is used to train and train models in the pipeline. For more information on the pipeline, visit the Pipeline API reference and the Pipeline Training Guide. The Pipeline Training guide is available on the Pipeline Wiki. The pipeline training guide can be downloaded from the GitHub repository.
