Transformers provides a set of preprocessing classes to help prepare your data for the model. The main tool for preprocessing textual data is a tokenizer. The tokens are converted into numbers and then tensors, which become the model inputs. For images, use a ImageProcessor to convert images into tensors. For speech and audio use a Feature extractor to extract sequential features from audio waveforms and convert them into Tensors. If you plan on using a pretrained model, it's important to use the associated pretrainedTokenizer. This ensures the text is split the same way as the pretraining corpus, and uses the same corresponding tokens-to-index during pretraining. The AutoProcessor always works and automatically chooses the correct class for themodel you're using, whether it's text, image, speech or audio. You can install datasets to experiment with your data in this tutorial. For more information on how to use Transformers, visit the Transformers website. The tutorial is open-in-colab, so please share it with your friends and family if you'd like to use it in your own research or for training your own models. It's free and open-source, so use it to test your data and train your models on your own data.
