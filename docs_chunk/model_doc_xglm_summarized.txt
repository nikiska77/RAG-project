The abstract from the paper is the following:Large-scale autoregressive language models such as GPT-3 are few-shot learners that can perform a wide range of language tasks without fine-tuning. While these models are known to be able to jointly represent many different languages,  their training data is dominated by English, potentially limiting their cross-lingual generalization. Our largest model with 7.5 billion parameters  sets new state of the art in few- shot learning in more than 20 representative languages. We present a detailed analysis of where the model succeeds and fails, showing in particular that it enables cross-ledual in-context learning on some tasks, while there is still room for improvement.
