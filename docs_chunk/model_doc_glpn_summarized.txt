GLPN combines SegFormer's hierarchical mix-Transformer with a lightweight decoder for monocular depth estimation. The proposed decoder shows better performance than the previously proposed decoders, with considerably less computational complexity. Our network achieves state-of-the-art performance over the challenging depth dataset NYU Depth V2. Finally, our model shows better generalisation ability and robustness than other comparative models. This is a recently introduced model so the API hasn't been tested extensively. There may be some bugs or slight changes to fix it in the future. If you see something strange, file a Github Issue. The GLPN model was proposed in Global-Local Path Networks for Monocular Depth Estimation with Vertical Cut Depth. The original code can be found here.
