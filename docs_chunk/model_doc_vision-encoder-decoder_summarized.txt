The [VisionEncoderDecoderModel] can be used toinitial an image-to-text model with any Transformer-based vision model as the encoder. The effectiveness of initializing models with pretrained checkpoints has been shown in TrOCR. An example application is image captioning, in which the. encoder is used to encode the image, after which an autoregressive. language model generates the caption. Another example is optical character recognition. The model can be saved/loaded just like any other models (see the examples below for more information). For more information on how to use the model, see the Vision Encoder Decoder Models section of the book. The book is published by Oxford University Press and is available for download from the Amazon Kindle store and the Google Play store.
