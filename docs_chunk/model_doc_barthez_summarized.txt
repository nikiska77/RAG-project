BARThez is the first BART model for the French language. It is on par with or outperforms CamemBERT and FlauBERT. It can be fine-tuned on sequence-to-sequence tasks in a similar way as BART, check: examples/pytorch/summarization/. It is the same as BART except for tokenization. The Authors' code can be found here. For more information on BART, see the BART documentation for information on configuration classes and their parameters. For information on the BARThez implementation, visit the BartThez documentation for details on how to use it in your own language.
