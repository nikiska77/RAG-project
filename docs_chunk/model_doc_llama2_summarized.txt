The Llama2 model was proposed in LLaMA: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models. It is a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, with checkpoints finetuned for chat application. The abstract from the paper is the following:In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection. of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and based on our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, may be a suitable model for dialogue use cases. Our fine- Tuned LLMs, called Llamas 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogueuse cases. We hope this will be a useful tool for the future development of chat systems. We are looking forward to seeing what the future holds for chat systems in the future. We will keep you updated on the latest developments in the Llama system. We look forward to hearing from you!
