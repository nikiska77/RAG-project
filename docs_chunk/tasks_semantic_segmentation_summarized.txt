Start by loading a smaller subset of the SceneParse150 dataset. This'll give you a chance to experiment and make sure everything works before spending more time training on the full dataset. In this guide, you'll only need image and annotation, both of which are PIL images. You'll also want to create a dictionary that maps a label id to a label class. Download the mappings from the Hub and create the id2label and label2id dictionaries. The next step is to load a SegFormer image processor to prepare the images and annotations for the model. Some datasets may not be available for training at the time of this article. For more information, visit the Huggingface Hub or the @Huggingface Twitter account.
