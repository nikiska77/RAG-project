Learn how to use FlashAttention-2 (a more memory-efficient attention mechanism), BetterTransformer (a PyTorch native fastpath execution), and bitsandbytes to quantize your model to a lower precision. Finally, learn how to Use Optimum to accelerate inference with ONNX Runtime on Nvidia and AMD GPUs. The majority of the optimizations described here also apply to multi-GPU setups! The guide is intended to help you get the most out of your machine learning software. It is not intended to be a complete guide to machine learning, nor does it cover all possible ways to improve the performance of machine learning programs. It's intended to provide a starting point for you to learn more about machine learning in the future. For more information on how to get started with this guide, please visit the official site. The guide has been updated to reflect the latest developments in machine learning and the latest versions of the ONNx language. It has also been updated with the latest version of the Python programming language, which is now available on all major platforms. The full guide can be downloaded from the GitHub repository: http://www.gpl.org/pip/ python/ python-3-3.0- python-4.0.0/ python_3-4-0.sh.
