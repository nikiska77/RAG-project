Transformers has a centralized logging system, so that you can setup the verbosity of the library easily. You can set it to one of the following: debug, info, warning, error, critical. Some warnings can be disabled by setting the environment variableTRANSFORMERS_NO_ADVISORY_WARNINGS to a true value, like 1. This will disable any warning that is logged using[logger.warning_advice]. All the methods of this logging module are documented below, the main ones are getting the current level of verbosity in the logger and setting the level of your choice. In order (from the leastverbose to the most verbose), those levels (with their corresponding int values in parenthesis) are:WARNING (int value, 30): only reports error and warnings. FATAL ( int value, 50): only report critical errors. The default level is WARNING. This is the default level used by the library. Here is an example of how to use the same logger as the library in your own module or script:import logging.logging.get_logger('transformers') from transformers.utils.get('logger') import logging.set_verbosity_info("INFO") logging.warning("WARN")
