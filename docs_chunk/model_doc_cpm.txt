The abstract from the paper is the following:
Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have proven to be beneficial for various downstream NLP tasks. Recently, GPT-3,
with 175 billion parameters and 570GB training data, drew a lot of attention due to the capacity of few-shot (even
zero-shot) learning. However, applying GPT-3 to address Chinese NLP tasks is still challenging, as the training corpus
of GPT-3 is primarily English, and the parameters are not publicly available. In this technical report, we release the
Chinese Pre-trained Language Model (CPM) with generative pre-training on large-scale Chinese training data. To the best
of our knowledge, CPM, with 2.6 billion parameters and 100GB Chinese training data, is the largest Chinese pre-trained
language model, which could facilitate several downstream Chinese NLP tasks, such as conversation, essay generation,
cloze test, and language understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPM achieves strong performance on many
NLP tasks in the settings of few-shot (even zero-shot) learning.
This model was contributed by canwenxu. The original implementation can be found

CPM's architecture is the same as GPT-2, except for tokenization method. Refer to GPT-2 documentation for 
API reference information.
