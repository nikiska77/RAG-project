ConvNeXt V2 is a pure convolutional model (ConvNet) inspired by the design of Vision Transformers. It is a successor of ConvNeXT. It was proposed in a paper by Sanghyun Woo, Shoubhik Debnath, Ronghang Hu, Xinlei Chen, Zhuang Liu, In So Kweon, Saining Xie. It significantly improves the performance of pure ConvNets on various recognition benchmarks, including ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation. A list of official Hugging Face and community resources to help you get started with ConvNeXT V2 can be found here. The original code for the model can be seen here. It can also be downloaded from the GitHub repository here. For more information, visit the Hugging face website. It has been updated to include the latest version of the ConvNeZet V2 model. It also has a new version of its code that is available for download. The full version of this article will be published in the next issue of Hugging Faces, which will be available in the first week of September. It will also include an image-recognition tool for the first time in this article. The code for this article is available here.
