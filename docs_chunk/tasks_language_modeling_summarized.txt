We encourage you to log in to your Hugging Face account so you can upload and share your model with the community. Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed.load the ELI5 dataset from the ðŸ¤— Datasets library. Split the dataset's train_asks split into a train and test set with the [~datasets.train_test_split] method. Then take a look at an example:Â 'answers': {'a_id': ['c3d1aib', 'c3D4lya'],'score': [6, 3], 'text': ["The velocity needed to remain in orbit is equal to the square root of Newton's constant times the mass of earth divided by the distance from the center of the earth"]}. Use the train_test method to test your model before spending more time training on the full dataset.summarize: Â "Why aren't there any stars visible in this photo?"Â "Because there are no other forces acting on either the shuttle or the guy, so they stay in the same position relative to each other. If he were to become unable to return to the ship, he would presumably run out of oxygen, or slowly fall into the atmosphere"
