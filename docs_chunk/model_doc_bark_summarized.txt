Bark is a transformer-based text-to-speech model proposed by Suno AI in suno-ai/bark. It is made up of 4 main models:[BarkSemanticModel] (also referred to as the 'text' model) [BarkCoarseModel] and [BarksFineModel] are called up sequentially during audio generation. Each of the first three modules can support conditional speaker embeddings to condition the output sound according to specific predefined voice. It can be optimized with just a few extra lines of code, which significantly reduces its memory footprint and accelerates inference. You can speed up inference and reduce memory footprint by 50% simply by loading the model in half-precision. The original code can be found here. The model was contributed by Yoach Lacombe (ylacombe) and Sanchit Gandhi (sanchit-gandhi). It is available for download from the Suno/Bark-small GitHub page, and can be downloaded from the GitHub page for the suno/bARK-small app, and from the Google Play store for the Android app, as well as the iOS app. It has been shown to work with a wide range of languages, including English and Spanish.
