The BLOOM model has been proposed with its various versions through the BigScience Workshop. It is essentially similar to GPT3 (auto-regressive model for next token prediction), but has been trained on 46 different languages and 13 programming languages. There is a list of official Hugging Face and community resources to help you get started withBLOOM. If you're interested in submitting a resource to be included here, please feel free to open a Pull Request and we'll review it! The resource should ideally demonstrate something new instead of duplicating an existing resource. Back to Mail Online home. Back To the page you came from.
