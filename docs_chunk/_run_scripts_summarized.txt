This guide will show you how to run an example summarization training script in PyTorch and TensorFlow. The example scripts are not expected to work out-of-the-box on every problem, and you may need to adapt the script to the problem you're trying to solve. Most of the scripts fully expose how data is preprocessed, allowing you to edit it as necessary for your use case. To successfully run the latest version of the example scripts, you have to install ðŸ¤— Transformers from source in a new virtual environment:git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/transformer-example.pip install. For older versions of the examples, click on the toggle below:ogle example scripts for older version of Transformers. You can also find scripts we've used in our research projects and legacy examples which are mostly community contributed. All examples are expected to working with both frameworks unless otherwise specified. The examples are not actively maintained. For any feature you'd like to implement in an example script, please discuss it on the forum or in an issue before submitting a Pull Request. While we welcome bug fixes, it is unlikely we will merge a pull request that adds more functionality at the cost of readability.
