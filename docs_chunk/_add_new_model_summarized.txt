How to add a PyTorch model to the Transformers library. We're trying to empower more of the community to actively add models. This guide will walk you through the process of adding a model to Transformers. A Hugging Face team member will be available to help you along the way so you'll never be alone. If you're interested in implementing a TensorFlow model, take a look at the How to convert a ðŸ¤— Transformers model to Tensor Flow guide. We hope this guide will help you get started with adding models to the library. For more information on how to add models to Transformers, please visit the Transformers website or follow the @Transformers Twitter account for updates on new models and more information about how to contribute to the @transformers Twitter feed. The #Transformers hashtag is used to share information about new models that are being added to the #transformers IRC channel. The hashtag is also used to promote the use of open-source best practices like black, ruff, and make fix-copies to ensure clean and readable code. We would like to make it clear that this guide is not meant to be a substitute for the full-blown Tensorflow tutorial. We are proud of our work with Tensor flow and would love to hear from you about your experiences with the tool.
