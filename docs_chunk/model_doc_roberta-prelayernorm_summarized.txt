RoBERTa-PreLayerNorm model was proposed in fairseq: A Fast, Extensible Toolkit for Sequence Modeling by Myle Ott, Sergey Edunov, Alexei Baevski, Angela Fan, Sam Gross, Nathan Ng, David Grangier, Michael Auli. The implementation is the same as Roberta except instead of using Add and Norm it does Norm and Add. Add andNorm refers to the Addition and LayerNormalization as described in Attention Is All You Need. This is identical to using the --encoder-normalize-before flag in fair sequencing. It is based on PyTorch and supports distributed training across multiple GPUs and machines. We also support fast mixed-precision training and inference on modern GPUs. This model was contributed by andreasmaden. The original code can be found here. The abstract from the paper is the following:.fairseq is an open-source sequence modeling toolkit that allows researchers and developers to train custom models for translation, summarization, language modeling, and other text generation tasks. The toolkit is based. on Pytorch and support distributed training. across multiple NVIDIA and AMD processors. It can also be used to train models for text classification, token classification, and question answering tasks.
