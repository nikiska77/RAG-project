Deformable DETR was proposed in Deformable Transformers for End-to-End Object Detection by Xizhou Zhu, Weijie Su, Lewei Lu, Bin Li, Xiaogang Wang, Jifeng Dai. It mitigates the slow convergence issues and limited feature spatial resolution of the original DETR by leveraging a new deformable attention module which only attends to a small set of key sampling points around a reference. It can achieve better performance than DETR (especially on small objects) with 10 times less training epochs. See the resources section below for demo notebooks. If you're interested in submitting a resource to be included here, please feel free to open a Pull Request and we'll review it! The resource should ideally demonstrate something new instead of duplicating an existing resource. The original code can be found here. The official Hugging Face and community (indicated by ðŸŒŽ) resources to help you get started with Deformal DETR can be seen here. For more information on how to use the model, please visit the HuggingFace website. The Hugging face is a free, open-source, community-funded project that aims to improve the accuracy of object detection in the open source software community. It was founded in 2010.
