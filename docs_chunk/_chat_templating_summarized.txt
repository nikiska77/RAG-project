Chat templates are part of the tokenizer. They specify how to convert conversations, represented as lists of messages, into a single tokenizable string. Different models expect very different input formats for chat. This is the reason we added chat templates as a feature. We hope you will use them to improve your chat experience in BlenderBot. For more information, visit the Blenderbot Chat Templating site or try it out in the beta version of the app. The full version of this article can be downloaded from the GitHub repository. It is available in version 2.4.1. The release version includes the chat template feature as well as a number of bug fixes and improvements. We are happy to answer any questions you may have about chat templating in the comments below or contact us at support@blenderbot.com with the question "How do you use chat templates in your chat model?’’. We would also like to hear from you about your experiences with chat models in the future. We’re looking forward to hearing from you in the next few months. Thank you for your support! We hope this article will help you with your chat experiences in the coming months and years. Back to the page you came from.
