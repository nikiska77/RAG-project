All models have outputs that are instances of subclasses of [~utils.ModelOutput]. Those are data structures containing all the information returned by the model. The outputs object is a [~modeling_outputs.SequenceClassifierOutput], which means it has an optional loss, a logits, an optional hidden_states and an optional attentions attribute. You can access each attribute as you would usually do, and if that attribute has not been returned by. the model, you will get None. Here for instance we have the loss since we passed along labels, but we don't havehidden_ states and attentions because we didn't pass output_hidden_states=True or output_attentions=True. Some models apply normalization or subsequent process to the last hidden state when it's returned. The output object can also be used as tuples or dictionaries. It has two elements, loss thenlogits, so for instance outputs.loss, outputs.logits[:2] will return the tuple (outputsloss, Outputs.Logits) for instance. It also has two keys that are keys that don't need to be used, such as output.hidden_state[-1] and output.last_hidden-states.
