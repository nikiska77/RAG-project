Hugging Face's Benchmarking tools are deprecated and it is advised to use external Benchmarked libraries to measure the speed and memory complexity of Transformer models. Let's take a look at how Transformers models can be benchmarked, best practices, and already available benchmarks. The benchmark classes [PyTorchBenchmark] and [TensorFlowbenchmark] allow to flexibly benchmark Transformers models. In the following example, it is shown how a BERT model of type bert-base-cased can be benchmarksed. The list arguments batch_sizes, batch_lengths, and sequence_ lengths are given to the benchmark argument data classes. The argument models is required and expects a list of model identifiers from the model hub. In inference, inference is defined by a single forward pass, and training isdefined by asingle forward pass and a single backward pass. A notebook explaining in more detail how to benchmark ğŸ¤— Transformers model can be found here.summarize:  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â Â Â HuggingÂ Face'sÂ benchmarkingÂ  tools areÂ departureÂ and it isÂ advisedÂ to use externalÂ benchmarksÂ toÂ measureÂ the speed Â and memory complexityÂ of TransformerÂ models.
