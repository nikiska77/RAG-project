Phi-1 is a Transformer-based model with 1.3B parameters. Phi-1 attains pass@1 accuracy 50.6% on HumanEval and 55.5% on MBPP. It is a new large language model for code, with significantly smaller size than other LLMs. It exhibits many of the traits of much larger LLMs such as the ability to “think step by step” or perform some rudimentary in-context learning. It was proposed in Textbooks Are All You Need II: phi- 1.5 technical report by Yuanzhi Li, Sébastien Bubeck, Ronen Eldan, Allie Del Giorno, Suriya Gunasekar and Yin Tat Lee. It has been used to train other large language models such as Phi-2 and Phi-3. It can be used to test the accuracy of machine learning models on a large number of different types of data, such as text, images, videos and audio. It also has the potential to be used as a training model for other languages such as English and Spanish. It will be used in the development of a new version of Textbooks, which is expected to be released in the next few months. The current version of this article is based on a version of the text that was published in the second edition of the textbook, Textbooks are All You need.
