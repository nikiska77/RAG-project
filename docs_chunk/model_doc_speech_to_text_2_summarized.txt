Speech2Text2 is a decoder-only transformer model that can be used with any speech encoder- only. It is always used within the SpeechEncoderDecoder framework. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the CoVoST Speech Translation dataset. The model was contributed by Patrick von Platen. The original code can be found here. For more information, see the official models for Speech2Text and Wav2Vec2. The tokenizer is based on fastBPE and is used to generate tokens for the model. It can also be combined with HuBERT for Speech-to-Text tasks. Please refer to the class on how to combine Speech2 text2 with any Speech-To-Text model to get the best results. The code for this model is available on GitHub and the code for the Speech Encoder Decoder framework is available at: http://github.com/speech2text2/Speech-Text-Decoder-Framework/releases/2013/08/09/speech-text-decoder-framework-1.0.0-beta.shtml. The language-based version of the model is called Speech2 Text2Tokenizer and it is used in the Speech Translation model for Speech Translation.
