The Speech2Text model was proposed in fairseq S2T: Fast Speech-to-Text Modeling with fairseq by Changhan Wang, Yun Tang, Xutai Ma, Anne Wu, Dmytro Okhonko, Juan Pino. It uses a convolutional downsampler to reduce the length of speech inputs by 3/4th before they are fed into the encoder. The model is trained with standard autoregressive cross-entropy loss and generates the transcripts/translations autoregressively. The feature extractor depends on torchaudio and the tokenizer depends on sentencepiece so be sure to install those packages before running the examples. On Ubuntu it can be installed as follows: apt install libsndfile1-dev-dev -dev Speech Translation and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST)import torchophobicfrom transformers import Speech2 textProcessor, Speech2textForConditionalGeneration. import load_load_speech_transcripts.import torchaudio sentencepiece.import load_speech-transcript_translations. import torchaudio-transformer-decoder-transformers-transport.import speech-transcription-translator-transporter-transplant.
