GPT-NeoX-Japanese is an autoregressive language model for Japanese. It is trained on top of https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox. Japanese is a unique language with its large vocabulary and a combination of hiragana, katakana, and kanji writing scripts. To address this distinct structure of the Japanese language, we use a special sub-word tokenizer. We are very grateful to tanreinama for open-sourcing this incredibly helpfultokenizer. The generate() method can be used to generate text using GPT NeoX Japanese model. For more information on this model-building activity, please refer here (ja). Use the example example below to see how the model works in a real-world situation. The model can be downloaded from GitHub here: http://www.gptneox-japanese-2.7b.org/gPT-neox-Japanese-model-example-1.0.0/GPTNeoxJapanese-Model-1-0.html#gpt_neox_Model-2-0-1_1. Use the examples below to help you understand the model and how to use it.
