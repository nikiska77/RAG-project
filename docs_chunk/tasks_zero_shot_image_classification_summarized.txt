Zero-shot image classification is a more flexible approach to image classification that allows models to generalize to new and unseen categories. It enables users to query images with free-form text descriptions of their target objects. In this guide you'll learn how to:create a zero- shot image classification pipeline;run zero-shots image classification inference by hand; and run zero-shotImageClassification inference. by hand. For more information on how to use this guide, visit the Hugging Face Hub's website or go to the PIL website. The PIL site is open-in-colab, and you can download the latest version of PIL from the Pil website.
