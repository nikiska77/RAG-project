TorchScript is a way to create serializable and optimizable models from PyTorch code. It is a focus of interest tous and we will deepen our analysis in upcoming releases. We explain how to export and use our models using TorchScript. We will also provide benchmarks comparing Python-based codes with compiledTorch script. We hope you will find this information helpful. We are still exploring TorchScript's capabilities with variable- input-size models. We would like to hear from you if you have any questions about TorchScript or how to use it in the future.
