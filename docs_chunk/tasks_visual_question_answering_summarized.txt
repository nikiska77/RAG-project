Visual Question Answering (VQA) is the task of answering open-ended questions based on an image. In this guide you'll learn how to fine-tune a classification VQA model, specifically ViLT, on the Graphcore/vqa dataset. Use your fine-tuned ViLT for inference. Run zero-shot VQa inference with a generative model, like BLIP-2. We encourage you to share your model with the community. Log in to your Hugging Face account to upload it to the #HuggingFace Hub.
