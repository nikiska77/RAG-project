Agents & Tools is an experimental API which is subject to change at any time. Results returned by the agents can vary as the APIs or underlying models are prone to change. To learn more about agents and tools make sure to read the introductory guide. This page contains the API docs for the underlying classes. We provide three types of agents: [HfAgent] uses inference endpoints for opensource models, [LocalAgent] using a model of your choice locally and [OpenAiAgent] use OpenAI closed models. These types have three specific purposes:Calling to_raw on the type should return the underlying object. Calling to_string on thetype should return a string. Wrapped objects should continue behaving as initially. A text object should still behave as a string, an image should still behaved as a PIL. The wrapped objects should display the object correctly in an ipython kernel. We implement wrapper classes around these types to increase compatibility between tools, as well as to render these returns in ipython (jupyter, colab, ipython notebooks, ), we implement wrapperclassesaround these types. These wrapper classes are available on GitHub. We hope you will use them to help you with your development. We are happy to share our code with you.
