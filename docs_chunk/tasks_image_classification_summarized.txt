We encourage you to log in to your Hugging Face account to upload and share your model with the community. Each example in the dataset has two fields: a PIL image of the food item and a label class.

The next step is to load a ViT image processor to process the image into a tensor.summarize:  grotesquely-properly-named-tensor-flow-model-for-food-items-in-the-training-set-from-hugging-face-datasets-library-vit-base-patch16-224-in21k.
