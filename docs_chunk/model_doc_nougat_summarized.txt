Nougat is an image Transformer and text Transformer model. It is used to translate scientific PDFs to markdown, enabling easier access to them. The model is identical to Donut in terms of architecture. It uses the VisionEncoderDecoder framework. Nougat can be downloaded from the GitHub repository. The original code for the model can be found at: http://www.nougat.org/nougat.html. The tutorial notebooks show how to use the model and how to fine-tune it for custom data.
