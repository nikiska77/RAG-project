The MegatronBERT model was proposed in Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using ModelparalleParallelism by Mohammad Shoeybi, Mostofa Patwary, Raul Puri, Patrick LeGresley, Jared Casper and Bryan Catanzaro. The model was contributed by jdemouth. The original code can be found here. The repository contains a multi-GPU and multi-node implementation of the Megatron Language models. In particular, it contains a hybrid model parallel approach using "model parallelism" and "model-parallelism" in PyTorch. The paper was published in the open-source journal Caffeine and C#. It was published on November 14, 2013.

It is based on the GPT-2 model, which has been used for years in language modeling. It has been described as "the most powerful language model in the world" and has been dubbed the "Megatron model"
