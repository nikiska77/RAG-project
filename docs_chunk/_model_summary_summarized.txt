The original Transformer model has inspired many new and exciting models that extend beyond natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Some models only use the encoder or decoder, while others use both. This taxonomy provides a useful taxonomy to categorize and examine the high-level differences within models in the Transformer family. If you aren't familiar with the original Transformers, check out the How do Transformers work chapter from the Hugging Face course. It'll help you understand Transformers you haven't encountered before.summarize:                 The Trans transformer model family includes the Vision Transformer, ConvNeXt, and the Swin Transformer. For more information, visit the Trans transformer family website or visit the Hackaday Transformer site. For a list of all the models in this taxonomy, visit Hackaday's Transformer Family website or go to Hackaday.com/Transformer-Family-Table. The list of Transformer models is also available on the Hackable Transformer page. For the full list of models, go to the Hackability Transformer website or the Hackables Transformer webpage. For an overview of the TransTransform family, see the Hackers' Transformer Handbook.
