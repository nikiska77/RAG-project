TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight framework for deploying machine learning models. It is designed to run models efficiently on devices with limited computational power, memory, and power. Optimum offers functionality to export Transformers models to TFLite through the exporters.tflite module. To export a model's checkpoint from the Hub, for example, run the following command:optimum-cli export tflite --model bert-base-uncased. To check out all available arguments, refer to the Optimum docs, or view help in command line: help.summarize:                                    export tFLite --help --sequence_length 128 bert_tFLite// bert.t Flite.tFlite.logits: max diff = 5.817413330078125e-05 (atol: 1e-5) The exported model was saved at: b Bert_tflites.logit.logite: max Diff: 5. 817413 330078 125e-01. The export succeeded with the warning: The maximum absolute difference between the output of the reference model and the T FLite exported model is not within the set tolerance 1E-05: 1 e-05.
