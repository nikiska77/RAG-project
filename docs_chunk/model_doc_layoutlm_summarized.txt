 layoutLM is a simple but effective pretraining method of text and layout for document image understanding. It obtains state-of-the-art results on several downstream tasks, such as form understanding and receipt understanding. The model also expects the input bbox, which are the bounding boxes (i.e. 2D-positions) of the input tokens. Each bounding box can be obtained using an external OCR engine such as Google's Tesseract (there's a Python wrapper available). It's the first time that text and layouts are jointly learned in a single framework for document-level pretraining. The paper is called LayoutLM: Pre-training of Text and Layout for Document Image Understanding. It was written by Yiheng Xu, Minghao Li, Lei Cui, Shaohan Huang, Furu Wei, and Qing Zhou. It is published in the open-source journal, Theoretical and Applied Computer Science (TCS) (http://www.tcs.org/2013/01/07/layout-lm-pre-training.html#storylink=cpy), and is available for download from the Mac OS X App Store and the Google Play Store. It's available in English, French, Spanish, and German.
