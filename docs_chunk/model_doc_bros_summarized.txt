BROS stands for BERT Relying On Spatiality. It is an encoder-only Transformer model that takes a sequence of tokens and their bounding boxes as inputs and outputs. BROS encode relative spatial information instead of using absolute spatial information. The model achieves comparable or better result on Key Information Extraction (KIE) benchmarks such as Wonseok Hwangâ€™s KIE benchmark. The BROS model was proposed in BROS: A Pre-trained Language Model Focusing on Text and Layout for Better Key information Extraction from Documents by Teakgyu Hong, Donghyun Kim, Mingi Ji, Wonsek Hwang, Daehyun Nam, Sungrae Park. It was published in the journal Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CPR) in 2012. It has been used in a number of academic publications since then, including the Journal of Computer Science and Graphics (JCSG) in 2013 and 2014. It can be downloaded from the JCSG website or the JCPG website. The JSCG version of BROS is available for download from the Google Play store for $3.99. It includes a free trial version of the BROS software. The full version is available on the JPG site for $4.99 and the JPC version for $5.99, and the full version will be available in the JMP version of $6.99 for $7.99 in the future.
