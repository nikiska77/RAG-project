The tokenizer library can be loaded directly into Transformers. The tokenizer object can now be used with all the methods shared by the ðŸ¤— Transformers tokenizers! Head to the tokenizer.page for more information. Use tokenizers from the Tokenizers library to train tokenizers in Transformers. Use the [PreTrainedTokenizerFast] class to instantiate a tokenizer from a JSON file. The [ pre_tokenizer] class can also be used to load tokenizer objects directly from the tokenizers library. For more information on how to use tokenizers with Transformers, visit the Transformers.org/transformer/tokenizers. The Tokenizer library is free and open-source, and can be downloaded from the GitHub site. It's free to use in any way you want, and there are no paid-for licenses for the library or its modules. The tokens can be used in any language that supports it, including Python, Ruby, and iOS. For example, you can use the Tokenizer class to train tokens in Python by importing the BPE tokenizer and the BpeTrainer tokenizer, and then using the B PE tokenizer to train the trainer on the files we've defined. TheTokenizer.class can be found on GitHub at:https://www.jmod.com/transformers/tokenizer.
