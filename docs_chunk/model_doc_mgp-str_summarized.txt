MGP-STR is a conceptually simple yet powerful vision Scene Text Recognition (STR) model. It is built upon the Vision Transformer (ViT) To integrate linguistic knowledge, Multi-Granularity Prediction (MGP) strategy is proposed to inject information from the language modality into the model in an implicit way. The resultant algorithm is able to push the performance envelop of STR to an even higher level. Specifically, it achieves an average recognition accuracy of 93.35% on standard benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art results on six standard Latin scene text benchmarks, including 3 regular text datasets (IC13, SVT, IIIT) and 3 irregular ones (IC15, SVTP, CUTE).This model was contributed by yuekun.
