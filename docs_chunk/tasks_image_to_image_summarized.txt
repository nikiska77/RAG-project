Image-to-Image task is the task where an application receives an image and outputs another image. This has various subtasks, including image enhancement (super resolution, low light enhancement, deraining and so on), image inpainting, and more. As of now, only Swin2SR models are supported in this pipeline. If you wish to do inference yourself with no pipeline, you can use the SwIn2SRForImageSuperResolution and Swin 2SRImageProcessor classes of transformers. We will use the same model checkpoint for this. We can now do inference with the pipeline. We'll get an upscaled version of the cat image. We won't use the pipeline for super resolution task, but for the same task without a pipeline. This guide will show you how to: Use an image- to-image pipeline for Super resolution task. Run image-to.image models for same task for Super Resolution task. Use a pipeline to run image-To-Image models for the Same Task without a Pipeline. Use the pipeline to do image inference for Superresolution task. The pipeline can also be used for Image Inpainting task. It can be used to do Image InPainting task for any image. It will use an image to. do image-in-painting. task.
