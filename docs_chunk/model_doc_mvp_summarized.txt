The MVP model was proposed in MVP: Multi-task Supervised Pre-training for Natural Language Generation by Tianyi Tang, Junyi Li, Wayne Xin Zhao and Ji-Rong Wen. MVP can be adapted to a wide range of generation tasks, including but not limited to summarization, data-to-text generation, open-ended dialogue system, story generation, question answering, question generation, task-oriented dialogue system and paraphrase generation. The detailed information and instructions can be found here.summarize:                 MVP is supervised pre-trained using labeled datasets. MVP also has task-specific soft prompts to stimulate the model's capacity in performing a certain task. For example, here is an example to use MVP and MVP with summarization-specific prompts.
