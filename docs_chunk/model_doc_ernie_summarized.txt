ERNIE is a series of powerful models proposed by baidu, especially in Chinese tasks. These models are contributed by nghuyong and the official code can be found in PaddleNLP (in PaddlePaddle).Take ernie-1.0-base-zh as an example:Python.from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel.from_pretrained("nghuyongs/ernie/1. 0- base-zh") AutoModel model.tokenizer = Auto tokenizer.from.from( "ernie" ) AutoModelmodel.model. checkpoints = Auto model. checkpoints. checkpoints (language) ERNIE-health-zh is an example of a health-based model. ERNie-Gram is a Gram-based version of the health-related model.ERNIE-Nano-zh was a Nano-based variant of thehealth-based models. It was used to test the health of the user. ERnIE-Health-zh can be used to check the state of a userâ€™s health. ER NLP is a NLP-based language. It can also be used for other languages such as English and Chinese. The official code for this language is available in PaddlePaddle.
