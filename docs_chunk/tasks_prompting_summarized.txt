Large Language Models such as Falcon, LLaMA, etc. are pretrained transformer models initially trained to predict the next token given some input text. Designing such prompts to ensure the optimal output is often called "prompt engineering" This guide covers the prompt engineering best practices to help you craft better LLM prompts and solve various NLP tasks. You'll learn:Basics of prompting and best practices of LLM prompting.Advanced prompting techniques: few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought.When to fine-tune instead of prompting. Text generation strategies and parameters are out of scope for this guide, but you can learn more about these topics in the following guides:    Generation with LLMs      Text generation strategies and parameters with LLMs.    “How to use LLM’s to solve NLP problems”, “How To Use LLMs to Solve NLP Problems’, “NLP Problems With LLMs,” ”NLP Problem Solving with LLM, ”“” and “’” ””.    “Use LLM to solve multiple N LP tasks out of the box by instructing the models with natural language prompts.
