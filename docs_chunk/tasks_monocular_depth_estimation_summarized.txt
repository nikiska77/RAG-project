In this guide you'll learn how to create a depth estimation pipeline. You'll also run depth estimation inference by hand. Make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed:pip install -q transformers Depth estimation pipeline depth estimation by hand depth by handdepth by hand Depth estimation inference. depth estimation.summarize: Â " depth" by depth estimation, depth by depth, depth_estimator by depth.depth by depth: " depth" (depth) by depth (tensor, depth) Depth by hand: "depth" ( depth) bydepth (tensor, depth, image) depth by Depth: " Depth" (t tensor, image, depth), depth. by Depth (t Tensor), depth (T Tensor, Depth, Image, depth). depth byDepth: "Depth" by Depth, depth (m meters) by Depth. by depth(m meters, depth.byDepth) depth.
