Fine-tuning is an incredibly powerful training technique. In this tutorial, you will fine-tune a pretrained model with a deep learning framework of your choice. The previous tutorial showed you how to process data for training, and now you get an opportunity to put those skills to the test!Begin by loading the Yelp Reviews dataset. Then, download a dataset and prepare it for training.summarize:                 Fine-t tune a pret trained model with Transformers [Trainer] or TensorFlow [Keras] or native PyTorch [Torch] The final step is to prepare the dataset for training with Keras or Pytorch. The final stage is to train the dataset on a dataset specific to your task. For more information, see the training phase of this tutorial and the final stage of the tutorial, which is the training of the dataset with the Keras deep-learning framework. The tutorial is also available on the GitHub repository, where you can download the dataset and train it with the deep-learn framework ofyour choice. It is available in English, Spanish, German, and French. The tutorials are available in German, French, and Spanish, and the German version of the tutorials is in English and the French version is in French.
