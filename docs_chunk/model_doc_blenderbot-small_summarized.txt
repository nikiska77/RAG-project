The Blender chatbot model was proposed in Recipes for building an open-domain chatbot by Stephen Roller, Emily Dinan, Naman Goyal, Da Ju, Mary Williamson, Yinhan Liu, Jing Xu, Myle Ott, Kurt Shuster, Eric M. Smith, Y-Lan Boureau, Jason Weston on 30 Apr 2020. The abstract of the paper is the following:Building open- domain chatbots is a challenging area for machine learning research. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice ofgeneration strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter models, and make our modelsand code publicly available. Human evaluations show our best models are superior to existing approaches in multi-turn conversations in terms of engagingness and humanness measurements. We then discuss the limitations of this work by analyzing failure cases of our models. The authors' code can be found here. The code for the Blenderbot Small model can be seen here. It is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than the left. It can be used in combination with the checkpoint                facebook/blenderbot-90M. Larger Blender bot checkpoints should be used with [BlenderbotModel] and [BlendersbotForConditionalGeneration]
