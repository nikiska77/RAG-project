This page looks at how models solve tasks and explains what's happening under the hood. Owing to its flexible architecture, most models are a variant of an encoder, decoder, or encoder-decoder structure. In addition to Transformer models, our library also has several convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are still used today for computer vision tasks. We'll also explain how a modern CNN works. To explain how tasks are solved, we'll walk through what goes on inside the model to output useful predictions. If you're just getting started or need a refresher, check out our course for more information. We hope to see you in the next episode of the What Transformers can do series on Monday, November 14, at 10pm ET (11pm GMT) or midnight ET (12pm ET) on Tuesday, November 15, and Wednesday, November 16, at 9am ET (10am GMT) on the same channel.
