In this guide, we will see how to create a custom pipeline and share it on the Hub or add it to theTransformers library. The structure of this breakdown is to support relatively seamless support for CPU/GPU, while supporting doing pre/postprocessing on the CPU on different threads. We will start by inheriting the base class Pipeline with the 4 methods needed to implement preprocess, forward, postprocess, and _sanitize_parameters.summarize:                 How to make your own custom pipeline in Python with the help of the transformers library and the Pipeline toolkit. The main goal is to keep the input as pure Python as possible (even through other languages via JSON). The simpler the input, the better. For example, the input could be strings, raw bytes, or whatever seems to be the most likely desired input. These will be the inputs of the preprocess method. For the postprocess method, the inputs could be bytes, strings, or any other data type. The simplest, the best. The outputs are the outputs of the post process method. This guide will show you how to do this in Python using transformers with the pipeline toolkit and the MyPipeline module. For more information, visit transformers.com.
