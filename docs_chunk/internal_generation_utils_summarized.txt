This page lists all the utility functions used by [~generation.GenerationMixin.generate]. Most of those are only useful if you are studying the code of the generate methods in the library. The output is a data structure containing all the information returned by the generate method. The generation_output object is a [~ generation.GreedySearchDecoderOnlyOutput], which means it has the following attributes:sequences, hidden_states,attentions, scores, and hidden_hidden_states. It can also be used as a dictionary or a tuples. The generated sequences are the sequences of tokens and tokens of the language modelling head. The hidden states are the hidden states of the model, for each generation step. They are also the attention weights of the models for eachgeneration step. For more information on GenerationMixin, see the official documentation. It's free and open-source, and can be downloaded from the GitHub repository. The source code is available on the GitHub site.
