TAPAS is a BERT-based model specifically designed (and pre-trained) for answering questions about tabular data. Compared to BERT, TAPAS uses relative position embeddings and has 7 token types that encode tabular structure. It has 2 heads on top: a cell selection head and an aggregation head, for (optionally) performing aggregations (such as counting or summing) among selected cells. It achieves state-of-the-art on both SQA and WTQ, while having comparable performance to SOTA on WikiSQL, with a much simpler architecture. The model has been fine-tuned on several datasets: SQA (Sequential Question Answering by Microsoft)- WTQ (Wiki Table Questions by Stanford University)- WikiSQL (by Salesforce). It has been shown to outperform or rivals semantic parsing models by improving accuracy on SQA from 55.1 to 67.1 and on WTQ from 55 to 67 per cent. It can also be used to answer questions in a variety of other languages, such as Spanish, German, French, and Italian. It is currently being trialled by Google and the University of California, San Diego. It's available for download from the Google Play store.
