MarkupLM is BERT, but applied to HTML pages instead of raw text documents. It incorporates additional embedding layers to improve performance. The model can be used for tasks like question answering on web pages or information extraction from web pages. It obtains state-of-the-art results on 2 important benchmarks: WebSRC and SWDE. The pre-trained model and code will be publicly available. The original code can be found here. The easiest way to use the model is with the MarkupLMProcessor. It expects 2 additional inputs, namely xpath_tags_seq and x Path_subs_seq. The code for the model and the usage guide are available here. It can be downloaded from the GitHub repository here. For more info on the model, see the Mark upLM website. It is open-source and free to download and use for a limited period of time.
