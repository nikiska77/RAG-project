Sci-fi movies/TV are usually underfunded, under-appreciated and misunderstood. I tried to like this, I really did, but it is to good TV sci-Fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek (the original) "summarized:  "text": "I love Sci-Fi and I'm willing to putting up with an awful lot. I'm not sure what to do with the rest of my life. I don't want to live in a post-apocalyptic world. I want to be able to go to the beach and enjoy the sun and the sand and the water and the stars and the moon and the animals and the plants and the birds and the fish and the insects and the flowers and the creatures and the wild animals. That's what I want for my life." Summarize : "Sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously. It may treat important issues, yet not as a serious philosophy"
