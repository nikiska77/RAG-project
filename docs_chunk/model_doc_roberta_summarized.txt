RoBERTa is based on Google's BERT model released in 2018. It builds on BERT and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence pretraining objective and training withmuch larger mini-batches and learning rates. It has the same architecture as BERT, but uses a byte-level BPE as a tokenizer (same as GPT-2) and uses a different pretraining scheme. Its best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. It can match or exceed the performance of every other model published after it. The original code can be found here. The code for RoBERTa was contributed by julien-c, and can be downloaded from the GitHub repository. It is available for download from the Github repository here. For more information, visit the RoBER Ta website. The model is available from the repository here as well as from the Google Play store. It was created by Yinhan Liu, Myle Ott, Naman Goyal, Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, OmerLevy, Mike Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer, Veselin Stoyanov, and Mandar Joshuai.
