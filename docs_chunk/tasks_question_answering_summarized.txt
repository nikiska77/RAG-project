We encourage you to login to your Hugging Face account so you can upload and share your model with the community. Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed.load a smaller subset of the SQuAD dataset from the ðŸ¤— Datasets library. Split the dataset's train split into a train and test set with the [~datasets.Dataset.train_test_split] method. Then take a look at an example of a model that answers a question about the Virgin Mary in Lourdes, France in 1858. It is a replica of the grotto at LourDES, where the Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 18 58. The answer is '5733be284776f41900661182', which means 'The Virgin Mary allegedly appeared to St. Bernadettes in 18 1958' in France. The question is: 'To whom did theVirgin Mary allegedly appear in1858 in Loursdes France?', which is a modern stone statue of Mary. The model can also answer questions about the history of the University of Notre-Dame, which is located in Paris, France. It can do this by looking at the university's website: http://www.huggingface.com/.
