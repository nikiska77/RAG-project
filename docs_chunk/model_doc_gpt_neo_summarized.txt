The GPTNeo model was released in the EleutherAI/gpt-neo repository by Sid Black, Stella Biderman, Leo Gao, Phil Wang and Connor Leahy. The architecture is similar to GPT2 except that GPT Neo uses local attention in every other layer with a window size of 256 tokens. The generate() method can be used to generate text using GPT Neo model. The model was contributed by valhalla. It is a GPT-Neo like causal language model trained on the                Pile dataset. To load and run a model using the model using flash-attn, install the latest version of Flash Attention 2 to include the sliding window attention feature. Make also sure to load your model in half-precision (e.g. `torch.float16``) to get the best performance. To use the model, run the command: python -u flash-Attention 2 -u no-build-isolation. To run the model with the command "gptNeo" you must use the command 'gptneo' to load the model. To test the model you can run it with the code: python-test-gpt Neo -u No-Build-Isolation.
