The Splinter model was proposed in Few-Shot Question Answering by Pretraining Span Selection by Ori Ram, Yuval Kirstain, Jonathan Berant, Amir Globerson, Omer Levy. Given a passage with multiple sets of recurring spans, we mask in each set allrecurring spans but one. Masked spans are replaced with a special token, viewed as a question representation, that is later used during fine-tuning to select the answer span. The resulting model obtains surprisingly good results on multiple benchmarks (e.g., 72.7 F1 on SQuADwith only 128 training examples), while maintaining competitive performance in the high-resource setting. If you plan on using Splinter outside run_qa.py, please keep in mind the question token - it might be important for the success of your model, especially in a few-shot setting. The model was contributed by yuvalkirstain and oriram. The original code can be found here.Please note there are two different different ways to use the model: using [SplinterTokenizer] and using [BertTokenizer], as it already contains this special token. The default behavior is to use this token when two sequences are given (for example, in the run_qas.py script).
