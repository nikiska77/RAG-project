SeamlessM4T is a collection of models designed to provide high quality translation. It enables multiple tasks without relying on separate models. Compared to strong cascaded models, Seamless M4T improves the quality of into-English translation by 1.3 BLEU points. It is the first multilingual system capable of translating from and into English for both speech and text. To build this, we used 1 million hours of open speech audio data to learn self-supervised speech representations with w2v-BERT 2.0. Subsequently, we created a multimodal corpus of automatically aligned speech translations. It achieves an improvement of 20% BLEu over the previous SOTA in direct speech-to-text translation. On FLEURS, SeemlessM 4T sets a new standard for translations into multiple target languages. It can be downloaded as an open-source project from the MIT Open Source Project website, and the code is available for download from the project's GitHub page.
