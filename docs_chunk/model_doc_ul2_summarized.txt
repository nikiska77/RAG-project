The T5 model was presented in Unifying Language Learning Paradigms by Yi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Vinh Q. Tran, Xavier Garcia, Dara Bahri, Tal Schuster, Huaixiu Steven Zheng, Neil Houlsby, Donald Metzler. The abstract from the paper is the following:Existing pre-trained models are generally geared towards a particular class of problems. To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. We present a generalized and unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP. We then propose Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre- Training objective that combines diverse pre- training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-Training schemes. Our method pushes the Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5 and/or GPT-like models across multiple diverse setups. By scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance on 50 well-established supervised NLP tasks ranging from language generation (with automated and human evaluation), language understanding, text classification, question answering, commonsense reasoning, long text reasoning, structured knowledge grounding and information retrieval.
