Transformers is a library of pretrained state-of-the-art models for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and audio and speech processing tasks. Not only does the library contain Transformer models, but it also has non-Transformer models like modern convolutional networks for computer vision tasks. This page provides an overview of the different speech and audio, computer vision and NLP tasks that can be solved with the ðŸ¤— Transformers library in just three lines of code.summarize:  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â What Transformers can do Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â ðŸ¤—Transformers can do: label audio, label music, label scenes, label events, label objects.
